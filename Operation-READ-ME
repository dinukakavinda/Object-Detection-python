This is blue colour object tracking example for python.
You can change the limits for the tracks by changing the limits of the following lines,
 
  blueLower = np.array([100, 67, 0], dtype = "uint8")
  blueUpper = np.array([255, 128, 50], dtype = "uint8")
  
This methods detect the largest contour that can detect in the picture.
If you want to run a custom video file you can just uncommnt the comments that I have put and run the file again.

ex :- ap = argparse.ArgumentParser()

      ap.add_argument("-v", "--video",
      help = "path to the (optional) video file")
      args = vars(ap.parse_args())
      
      (Put the file you want to run in the video file path)
